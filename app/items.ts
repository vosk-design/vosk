Our goal was to seamlessly integrate both elements without compromising design or usability.\n\nThe website is divided into two primary sections. The first showcases the studio's projects and provides information about the team, giving users immediate access to BQ Studio's portfolio. Filters allow for quick navigation through categories like landscape design and master planning. We created two viewing modes: a visually-driven option for users who prefer to explore projects through images, and a card-based option for streamlined project browsing.

This reflects the concept of soft power – a gentle force that transforms the environment subtly, without disrupting it. In the role of the 'Creative Director of the Environment,' BQ Studio guides these transformations, shaping harmonious and cohesive spaces.\n\nThe graphic elements in BQ Studio's identity are dynamic, 'living' structures that represent real processes within the environment. They occasionally break grids and rules, symbolizing an ever-changing reality that can evolve in various directions. The typography supports this by being clean and precise, yet with experimental elements, reflecting the brand's flexibility and adaptability. As the 'Creative Director of the Environment', BQ Studio balances conceptual architecture with real-life functionality, creating spaces where aesthetics and function merge seamlessly.",

With just 2-3 scrolls, it focuses on delivering key information clearly. The platform is designed to meet the needs of both beginners and professionals. Newcomers are introduced to essential features through interactive widgets with brief, straightforward descriptions, while professionals can explore more in-depth details by clicking on these widgets, which open internal pages for further insights.\n\nAdditionally, the interactive widgets reflect the product's interface, allowing users to explore features in a hands-on, engaging way, with each widget displayed clearly on a single card per screen.\n\nA key part of the design is the dashboard, which provides a quick overview of all available and upcoming features. This allows users to easily revisit important tools or discover new ones without needing to scroll through the entire page. This structure ensures a seamless user experience, keeping the focus on what matters most while making it easy to explore Plancy's capabilities.",

The exploration of river bends and their karst imprints on Earth's surface, the whole aquatic landscapes led brand's jewelry designers to the idea of LETHE. The storyline originates in Greek mythology, where Lethe is the river of eternity flowing in the underworld. Like Lethe, each diamond exists beyond time.\n\nOur challenge was to create a full-fledged campaign to support a loud launch of the collection. We wanted to carefully convey the essence of jewelry design so the CGI was chosen as the best possible technology to transmit the glow of a small diamond crumb.",

Our task was to collaborate with the client's team to conduct extensive research on positioning and to launch the brand into the market.\n\nOver the course of two months, we conducted extensive research and a series of strategic and branding workshops with the involvement of the client's team. This effort resulted in a shared vision for the future brand and its unique advantages.\n\nStemps offers up-to-date, concentrated knowledge in the field of design, curated expert content, an accurate assessment of professional skill levels, and practical application of knowledge. Stemps is constantly seeking the most current technologies and tools available on the market. The quality of content selection for training is of paramount importance. The foundation of Stemps' education is its top-tier professionals, who are practicing specialists working daily with the latest methodologies.

Another requirement was to find a technique that would succinctly and precisely convey the brand\'s character—direct and to the point, with no unnecessary elements.\n\nWe found the technique of overlaying/intersecting of two forms. It creates a concentration that demonstrates how our knowledge and skills evolve through learning at the intersection of disciplines.\n\nThis technique is used in the logo and all brand communication materials. Due to the variability of changes at the intersection of forms, the style can continually refresh and appear new, thus conveying the idea of relevance.\n\nThe naming is closely tied to the strategy and identity. The word "Stemps" encodes several meanings. "Steps" implies steps, sequence, and action. "Stem" represents an approach based on the integration of various disciplines, making the learning process as effective as possible.',

Fullscreen View: Offering a closer look, users can appreciate the details of each project.\n\nBy incorporating transitions between these modes with a simple click, we ensure a smooth and intuitive browsing experience that aligns with IND Architecture's forward-thinking approach.\n\nIn addition to highlighting the visual aspects of IND Architecture's projects, we also focused on presenting essential information in a clear and concise manner. Through careful analysis, we identified that clients prefer succinct yet informative content that emphasizes the quality of IND Architecture's work. As such, we developed a design solution that extends the screen beyond its visible limits, allowing for the seamless presentation of key project details while keeping additional content readily accessible.",

        text: "G8 is an independent festival of the creative industries, orchestrated by REDKEDS agency. Every year, the team engages various partners to craft a unique identity, providing a platform for design studios and independent experts to express themselves.\n\nOur aim was to create something simple, quick, and uncomplicated. Not trash-design, but something a bit rough, casual, and easy to work with. We delved into the semantics of 'unboxing' and realized it's about 'release'. But to release something, you need to package it first. This led us to the metaphor of a box or packaging. We decided to playfully critique the era we live in—marketers and creative designers flocking to the festival to sell themselves. It's a kind of hypocrisy. It reminded us of \"Vanity Fair\". In truth, any festival is about this: people come to flaunt their ego, literally packaging themselves in their work to market themselves.",

We took this idea and merged it with our trash-3D approach. The result is a tool where a photograph is uploaded, any object in the photo is automatically cut out, and one can manipulate the volume, materials, angles, and add additional elements on top of the object. In our case, these are labels.",

This type of tag, often found on clothing, is associated with something that can be easily taken along, akin to the modular homes which can be swiftly transported to any location. The brand's key emotional qualities are also expressed in its color scheme, typography, graphics, and composition. The modular structure conveys a sense of reliability and precision.",

Design Aid specializes in creating "interactive spaces", offering a full artistic service from architecture and design to visual identity. It aims for a perfect synthesis of ethics, aesthetics, passion, and cultural context.\n\nBrand\'s identity is based on qualities such as ambiguity, imperfection, incompleteness, and the pursuit of form. The team does not seek to be understood outright. Their goal is to collaboratively shape a statement that becomes an extension of their identity.',
